      p Each day we're publishing a new Dataset of the Day and sharing on social media.
      p Here's why we believe in open data repositories:
      ol.ui.ordered.list
        li.item They provide a source of insight and transparency into the domains and organizations that are represented by the data sets.
        li.item They enable value creation across a variety of domains, using the data as the “fuel” for innovation, government transformation, new ideas, and new businesses.
        li.item They offer a rich variety of data sets for data scientists to sharpen their data mining, knowledge discovery, and machine learning modeling skills.
        li.item They allow many more eyes to look at the data and thereby to see things that might have been missed by the creators and original users of the data.
        li.item They enable numerous “data for social good” activities (hackathons, citizen-focused innovations, public development efforts, and more).
