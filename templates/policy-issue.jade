          strong What kind of topics for data stories and sets is Data4America interested in?
          p Data4America is primarily interested in data stories and sets that are related to political and policy issues important in the United States. 
          p Interesting data stories and sets may have an international or global focus or comparative dimension but the involvement of American interests should be highlighted. Besides national and international focused stories and sets, those concerned with state and local issues are also of interest. 
          p In future, versions of the Data4America platform may be established for other countries.

            div.ui.divider
            strong What do you mean by “data story”?
            p For data sets to have a meaningful influence on debate and conversation, their significance has to be translated into a story form that expresses the significance and impact of the data on how people and organization understand and take action in the world. 
            p In your submitted story article, we would like you to write about the most important and salient ones from your data set that relevant for the politics/policy area that you have in mind.  
            p Alternatively, you can also write about how people can use the data set to tell impactful stories. Data4America also considers such articles as a kind of data story.
            p We are also interested in original data sets that are generative sources for new and influential storytelling about policy even if you don’t write about the stories but are willing to allow others to use them in this way (see discussion of data licensing below).
            div.ui.divider

            strong What kinds of data visualization are you looking for?
            p Excellent data stories will come with excellent visuals that add to the explanatory power and communicative impact of the story. We are open to all possibilities. 
            div.ui.divider

            strong Who should submit data stories and data sets?
            p Data4America accepts submissions from anyone and everyone including: data scientists, data journalists, data designers, students, think tanks, political organizations, open data enthusiasts, and government organizations. 
            div.ui.divider

            strong Can I submit a data story based on someone else’s data set?  
            p No—your data set should be of created by yourself or a team that you belong to.
            p The data set must either be public property or you will need documented permission from the owner to publish.
            div.ui.divider


            strong Can I submit a data set on its own without a story?
            p Yes. you can submit a data set on its own. If approved and selected for publication, we’ll give you $50 for this.
            div.ui.divider

            strong Can I submit a data story without a full data set? Does Data4America require that the data set underlying the story be made open source?
            p For the Data4America editorial approval process, all data stories must be submitted with access to the full data sets underlying the stories. 
            p If your data story is approved and selected for publication, you will have the option of making your data set open source. You do not have to make it open source for successful selection and publication by Data4America. If approved, you can earn an additional stipend if you make the data set open source through the Data4America process—see What do I get if my submission is selected? below. If you choose not to make it open source, we will fully respect your decision.
            p Whether your submission is selected and published or not, any data stories and sets that you give us during the editorial process will be kept private and confidential unless you explicitly agree otherwise. 
            div.ui.divider

            strong Do I have to be a professional data scientist or data journalist to make a submission?
            p Not necessarily, but 
            div.ui.divider

            strong OK, how do I submit data stories and sets to Data4America?
            p Your data stories and sets must be complete and original. The stories should never have been published elsewhere. You must ensure and confirm that they are 100% legitimately sourced and 100% accurate to the best of your ability. We’ll reject any story that is not original, has non-authoritative data sources, problematic data, or otherwise falls short of Data4America’s standards. 
            p Email your story along with your data visualization, data model, or infographic to submit@data4america.org. You must also include your biographical profile as well as, if available,  your Twitter address,and your LinkedIn profile link (or other suitable online profiles). You can also include your resume with the email.  Finally, remember to include the Github or other hosted link to download your underlying data set. 
            div.ui.divider

            strong How does Data4America approve submissions?
            p New submissions are reviewed by the Editorial Board and approved on a rolling basis. You may be asked to make revisions or submit additional material before the Editorial Board takes a vote. 
            div.ui.divider

            strong What do I get if my submission is selected?
            p If your data story is approved and selected, you’ll receive a $500 one-time, non-recurring stipend from Data4America. This is for a single story; you may receive further stipends for additional stories, if selected. Multiple story submissions can be based on the same data set.
            p Every data story published by Data4America should be accompanied by its underlying data set or, in the case where the data set is not licensed for open source access, links should be provided to the data creators. If a data story submission is based on a data set that has already been licensed as open source, that is also acceptable. 
            p We may approve the underlying data set but not the story. In that case, we will give you the option of only having the data set published on the terms below.
            p If your data story or set is selected and you agree to give your data set, if eligible, an open source license  (for more information about open data licensing, see http://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/what-is-open-data/ )and allow it to be published by Data4America, you will receive a $50 one-time, non-recurring stipend. Please note that for this data set stipend and publication to be approved, the data set must not have already been made available to the public elsewhere. The data will be available to the public for free download at data.data4america.org. The stipend here is separate from any payment made for stories based on the data. This is for a single data set; you may receive further stipends for additional data sets, if selected.
            p If selected and published, your data stories and/or sets will also be promoted under Data4America brand; the content’s “created by” attribution will be clearly given to you and any co-authors. The content also may be syndicated to media partners around the world. No further payments for authorship data story or set will be made by Data4America if  syndication of them occurs. 
            div.ui.divider

            strong Is Data4America interested in submissions that are politically partisan or advocating for particular causes?
            p Data4America is a non-partisan organization, and we take this perspective seriously. The Editorial Board may reject articles or ask for them to be revised due to bias problems. Data sets will be examined for such issues. Causes advocacy data stories and data sets will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Counterpoint arguments, stories, and data sets may be added.
            div.ui.divider

            strong Is there a wordcount requirement?
            p We think that 500 to 1,500 words is a good rule-of-thumb.
