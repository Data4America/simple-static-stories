          h3.ui.header About Lincoln
          p Lincoln Initiative, formerly known as Lincoln Labs, was born from the optimistic view that when technology and public policy meet, under the right conditions and with the right tools, both worlds win. Through hackathons, meetups and online engagement, we provide opportunities for the entrepreneurial community to come together and both collaborate on and learn about market-based, tech-powered solutions to our nation's biggest problems.

          h3.ui.header Fireside Chat with Scott Weiner
          p San Francisco is among the hardest hit by the urban housing crisis. While tech companies do not control city policy, they are feeling pressure to find a solution that both allows them to bring in more tech workers and also does not push out existing residents. 
          p Opinions on how to deal with housing--and inequality more generally--differ sharply in the Bay Area. Some just want tech companies to relocate elsewhere. Others want tech companies to pay heavy fees to subsidize affordable housing. And, both of these solutions are challenged by suburban neighborhood associations that don't want to see their quaint homes disturbed by high-rise condos for tech workers. 
          p The political gridlock is harming the economy, too. Berkeley Economist Enrico Moretti estimates that housing regulation alone in three major cities has stunted US GDP by about 10%. 
          p What is the solution? Should tech companies become politically involved or is there a more constructive role for them to play in addressing the housing crisis?

          h3.ui.header Fireside Chat with Keith Rabois
          p The highly anticipated Apple vs. FBI court battle was abruptly halted. After insisting that Apple’s help would be the only way to access data stored on the device, the FBI was able to circumvent the phone’s security features via an undisclosed third-party solution.
          p Although temporarily resolved, this was clearly the first scuffle in what will be an on-going encryption and data privacy battle. On one side, there is a national security argument - strong encryption makes it harder for law enforcement to do their job. On the other, there’s the obligation to protect consumer data - weaker encryption make consumers susceptible to hackers. Do both of these arguments hold up to scrutiny or are they based on flawed premises? What happens next in the battle of encryption? How can civil liberties be preserved amid the ever evolving world of terrorism, which increasingly relies on technology to coordinate attacks? Can the government force cooperation from an unwilling company?
