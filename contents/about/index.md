What is Data4America?
A non-profit, educational initiative bringing data science to the understanding of politics.

1/ We bring together some of the brightest in the data science, government, and technology communities to serve the non-profit sector: http://data4america.org/team

2/ We crowdsource, edit, and then publish stories from the data science and data journalism communities: https://data4america.org/geography-american-jobs/

3/ We publish Lifemap, history in 100 characters or less: http://lifemap.io/berniesanders

4/ We publish user-generated policy stories: http://test.data4america.org/basic-income/

5 /We promote open data sets: https://twitter.com/data4america/status/659145577301585920

6/ We open source some of data sets underneath our published stories: https://datahub.io/dataset/where-are-the-jobs

7/ We open source the code bases underneath our published data models: https://github.com/Data4America/basic-income-basic-job

8/ We open source the recipe for how the data science in our published stories works: https://github.com/Data4America/jobmaps

9/ We enable the private sector to sponsor policy ideas so our curation and editorial board engines have a steady stream of unique content to publish: https://data4america.org/issues/

10/ We experiment with innovative ideas that help bring data science to the understanding of politics. Some work, some don't; we double down on the one's that do.
