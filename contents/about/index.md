# **Data Journalism for a 21st Century Government**

Data4America is a non-partisan, not-for-profit, and crowdsourced media organization bringing data science, data visualization, and open data sets to government.

**How It Works:** Anyone can submit a data visualization, data model, or infographic to Data4America.

Our non-partisan Editorial Board evaluates and votes on the crowdsourced data journalism. Published stories are syndicated to media partners and promoted throughout social media. The underlying data sets and code bases can be open sourced for anyone to use--for free. Published stories include a “Create Your Own” element so anyone can re-generate the story with their own unique data set. Creators of published stories and open data sets receive stipends.
