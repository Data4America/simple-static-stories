# About

**Data Journalism for a 21st Century Government**

Data4America is a non-partisan, non-profit crowdsourced media platform bringing data science to politics.

**How It Works:** Anyone can submit a data visualization, data model, or infographic to Data4America.

Our non-partisan Editorial Board evaluates and votes on the crowdsourced data journalism based upon its math integrity, data authority, and bias.

Our published stories are syndicated to media partners and promoted throughout social media. The underlying data sets and code bases can be open sourced.

Published stories include a "Create Your Own" element so readers can re-generate the data science with their own unique data set. Creators of published stories and published data sets receive stipends.
