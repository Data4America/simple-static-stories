## Section: Environment
Data4America seeks a non-partisan and verified data tear down of the three big proposals about the environment: Cap and Trade vs. Carbon Tax vs. Do Nothing

Once approved, we'll work with you to transform your analysis into a user-generated app enabling our readers to input values about their own communities into the data model so they can produce their own user-generated data visualization/data model/etc. 

Then, share on social media so civic discourse and understanding of the issues can involve more people.

Example of a user-generated model: <a href="/basic-income-basic-job/" target="_blank">A new social contract: Basic Income vs. Basic Jobs</a>

## Rewards
Our approved content creator will receive a $5,000 stipend from Data4America, a Data4America tee-shirt, and membership into our Content Creator network on Slack.
