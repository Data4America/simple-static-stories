      "This policy channel calls for the United States to legalize the recreational use of marijuana.",
      "Currently twenty-four states have enacted laws that allow recreational and/or medical use, and many states have decriminalized the possession of small amounts. In 2014, fifty percent (95,800) of inmates in federal prison were being held for drug-related crimes. Incarceration costs the U.S. $20,000 more per inmate per year than drug treatment."
