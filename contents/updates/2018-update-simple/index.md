                                          <a href="https://data4america.org/">Data4America</a>, a nonpartisan, nonprofit initiative intended to increase the understanding of policy through data and communications, enters 2018 with a focus on important issues such as the future of work and a universal basic income.

                                          Working with the <a href="http://joinlincoln.org/">Lincoln Network</a>, D4A is coordinating a Conversation event that would include Stockton Mayor Michael Tubbs, who is running a UBI trial in his town, and a policy advisor to former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Both have confirmed interest in such an event, which most likely would occur during the first half of the year.

                                          Also this year, D4A plans to release recordings of podcasts created as part of a UBI research partnership with the Lincoln Network on the topic of UBI.

                                          Data4America’s Conversations are invitation-only, revenue-generating events at which Democrats, Republicans, Independents and others get together for “no-small-talk” policy discussions. This year’s first is planned for March.

                                          D4A is reaching out to other nonprofit policy groups, like <a href="http://www.t4a.org/">Tech4America</a>, to advance public conversations around topics like the Future of Work. These happen in a private setting, but usually involve a public figure, such as a governor, senator, or other high-ranking official with government experience.

                                          Executive Director Chris McCoy said these events are important to achieve the organization’s mandate of not only helping the public -- but helping the elected officials who lead the public -- understand policy, with a bent on technology. McCoy recently became a member of the World Economic Forum and will contribute to the WEF’s global cross data flows and blockchain initiatives.

                                          Data4America, which filed for 501(c)(3) nonprofit status in the third quarter of 2017, has set a fundraising goal of $50,000 for this year. Tax-deductible donations can be made at <a href="http://data4america.org/donate">http://data4america.org/donate</a>.
