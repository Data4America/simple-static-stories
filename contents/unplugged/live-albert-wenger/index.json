Welcome to our podcast, Unplugged, where we unpack the intersection of data, government, technology, and the future with some of America's best thinkers. Today is our first-ever roundtable: we brought together six people in a single room to discuss the future of jobs, automation, basic income, and what that means for America. It was hosted by Data4America board member Kim-Mai Cutler, and our special guest was venture capitalist and author Albert Wenger from Union Square Ventures. I recommend you download and read his book, World After Capital, at http://worldaftercapital.org. <br><br>Our panelists and guests ranged across the aisle throughout Silicon Valley and beyond, including Chad Grills from The Mission, venture capitalist Will Eden from Thiel Capital, Tyler Willis, entrepreneur and investor, myself, and Jim Pugh and Sandhya Anantharaman from the Universal Income Project. We also had France 2 there, one of the top TV networks in all of Europe - 3.5 million people watch their show every night. They recorded it and will hopefully broadcast it shortly. <br><br>If you like this roundtable discussion, share it with your friends on Twitter, Facebook, and Product Hunt. Help us get distribution, and if you support our work of bringing data science and visualization to the understanding of policy, we'd greatly appreciate it if you donated to help us. With that said, let's go in."

The topic we're going to be discussing today is universal basic income, which is an idea that has caught some kind of flight in Silicon Valley amid concerns about job automation, income inequality, and changes that are going to come about with the reemergence of artificial intelligence after a long winter. We’re exploring how society is going to cope with that in terms of figuring out programs that enable people, rather than dislocate them as this change potentially happens over the next generation.<br><br>We have a whole circle of people with us here today: Tyler Wallace who's a founder here, Albert Wenger from Union Square Ventures, Chad who runs The Mission, which is a publication that covers technology, Will from Thiel Capital, who invest in early stage life science companies, and Jim and Sandhya from the Universal Income Project. I think I want to start off by giving people a basic understanding and overview, and I'm going to turn to you guys. Tell us a little bit about what universal basic income is, how it works, and where the idea originated from."

Rather than having a patchwork quilt of different social programs, and having to figure out what's right for what situation, you have one program that guarantees you're going to bring people up to the level where they're actually able to get by - cover food, cover housing, and be able to make it from there."

Martin Luther King actually talked about a guaranteed minimum income as what he saw as the next step in terms of increasing equity. You also had conservative economists like Milton Friedman discuss this as a better way to make sure that people had a base floor of income. In fact, there were four state experiments looking at the the effect of replacing welfare programs, food stamps, energy subsidies, equities, with cash. There was definitely a concerted movement toward this idea in the sixties and seventies before it died out."

There's a couple of big drivers of that: one is that inequality has gotten a lot worse, and there's a lot of strain on the system we have today. There's concern that if we don't figure out good ways to address this and bring everyone up to a sufficient level, the repercussions on our society as a whole could be very negative.<br><br>Beyond that, I think it's become much more visible what impact advances in automation may have in our society - not in the distant future, but in just a few years, certainly in the next 10 or 20 - and that could really change the way our job and labor markets work. It could flip the idea that everyone should have a long term, full time job on its head and force us to recognize that we need some radical new programs that actually guarantee that everyone is going to have that floor."

        "text":"The book's online in draft form at http://worldaftercapital.org. I came to this about four or five years ago when I started looking into some large-scale statistical data on what's happening with GDP growth and the distribution of GDP. There's a famous chart called the Uncoupling Chart, which shows that around twenty years ago, GDP continued to grow, but the distribution of GDP shifted between labor and capital. What was happening was that the labor component of GDP was almost flat.<br><br>I started thinking about it, and I started writing about it, and a lot of people come at it from saying this is sort of a terrible thing. There's fear of future job losses and further deterioration, and that was my early thinking about this as well. Now, I think of it much more as a great opportunity. It is an opportunity for almost anybody to be much freer in their allocation of time, and for a long time we had tied up a lot of people in things that aren't great to do.<br><br>There's two different ways of looking at the uncoupling: one is to say it's terrible, jobs are going away, work is going to go away, and we need to figure out how to get back to full employment and everybody having a job. Because the world has revolved so much around capital in the industrial era, the way we're thinking - the way policymakers are thinking about doing this - is, \"Let's make capital cheap. Let's have quantitative easing, more capital deployed, and that'll create jobs.\"<br><br>But what's happening is that capitalists become this amazing substitute for labor. If you still continue on this path - the path that we're currently on - then the substitution's bad. If you figure out how to use this as a way of freeing everybody, to help them truly be able to decide what to do with their time, it becomes a very positive thing. How do you flip that switch? Universal basic income is the way. As a VC, I've been calling it seed capital for the people. Why does an entrepreneur need seed capital? So she can work on her startup. If everybody had some amount of seed capital, they could work on the things of interest to them."

        "text":"One tension that I see a lot in Silicon Valley in general is that you talk to all these thinkers and visionaries creating all these big, broad ideas, but in the world of institutions and systems and politics, it's one thing to have a grand theory of change and it's another to do the hard work of education, awareness, advocacy, institution building, organizing, and having some kind of effective change that comes out of law.<br><br>When I hear the idea of universal basic income, it sounds very appealing, but then you look at the history of American culture and its orientation toward who constitutes the deserving poor vs. the undeserving poor - a concept rooted in American puritanical ethics. That cultural attitude has obviated and negated attempts at having broad-based social programs. How do you overcome this deeply-rooted cultural attitude we have in this country, where everyone should have income regardless of who they are or what their background is?"

I think that it started happening around 1928, 1930, and if I had to define it I would call it hedonistic communism. Just yesterday, I came back from the Oslo Freedom Forum here in San Francisco - an amazing event. I'm getting to see women - I can call them founders, but visionaries who are taking immense personal risks for freedom to build their companies.<br><br>For example, one of the journalists from Charlie Hebdo was there, has three full-time security guards, gets constant death threats, constant threats of fatwa, and I find it so hard that here in America we're talking about universal basic income. We don't have any money. Certain people have a lot of money, but the question remains very open as to how we're going to reallocate that capital. I think universal basic income is a wonderful concept rooted in some wonderful humanitarian beliefs and aesthetics, but I worry about how we're going to get there."

        "text":"Let me try and react to the comment that was just made. I think that one of the fundamental changes that's occurring is that much of the benefit we're unlocking from technology is not occurring in the form of traditional GDP growth. When you take, as an example, Encyclopedia Britannica, and replace it with Wikipedia, you have reduced the amount of GDP that goes around, but you have also massively increased access.<br><br>I think if we try to get to the question of affordability of basic income by thinking about taking the existing pie and slicing it differently, I think we're already stuck in a mistake of thinking about the change in the economy. That's the reaction that I have. Tying it back to Chris's question, the fundamental difference about digital technology compared to what's come before is that it has zero marginal cost and it has universality, which makes it different from analog technology. A tractor is a wonderful way of ploughing fields and it replaces many horse-drawn or ox-drawn ploughs, but it can't also forecast the weather.<br><br>Computer programs can carry out any computation, and they can carry it out at zero marginal cost. I think as long as we get caught in this trap of counting dollar product output, we are going to be caught in the trap of saying there's not enough money to go around to pay for this. I believe we live in a fundamentally deflationary world and we could essentially print much of this money without causing inflation the way it occurs traditionally. More people should chime in on this."

I thought you made a great point in the book in looking at the resources we actually need to get by and recognizing that there's enough already. We have enough food to feed everyone, enough housing to go around, all the things we need for people. It's just a matter of finding the right ways to access them. As we are progressing with technology that's creating value all around, we should figure out a system that actually frees that up and allows us to continue to pursue that."

However, there are a couple sectors - namely healthcare, education, and housing - that have become externally much more expensive. At least from my personal experience of California, it feels like because of this abundance of capital, capital is getting absorbed or soaked into very scarce, legally-protected and government-subsidized assets like real estate and housing. How do you explain or account for that, and what kinds of reforms could you create that would adjust some of those spaces where there isn't a deflationary effect that's obvious?"

At the edges, we are seeing them. There's Khanacademy, there are amazing educational resources on YouTube. They're all free, but because the system has so many interlocking parts - how companies are hiring, how you get into a good college, what nursery school you go to - that system will take a long time to change.<br><br>If you look at current trend lines, we're very much at the inflection point where healthcare and education - you should talk about healthcare investing - are going to decrease.<br><br>When it comes to real estate, one of the truly amazing things about universal basic income is that it doesn't force you to live in a particular place. Another way to think about what universal basic income lets you do is that it's a walk away option. It's a walk away option from a bad job, a bad city, a bad spouse. One of those predictions - that by 2050, everybody is going to live in cities - is entirely predicated on this idea that you take the existing trend line and extrapolate it. Why are people moving to cities? Because it's the only place where you can earn a living."

        "time":"[17:40]",
        "text":"Yeah. I would say housing, healthcare, and education all have different things going on, and it's very relevant to separate these out. The housing point is largely cities; cities are becoming vastly more expensive, and more people live in cities. There are different ways to tackle this problem; in my view, if we're paying someone a guaranteed minimum income, it's not a guarantee that they're going to get to live in San Francisco, and it's not a guarantee that they're going to get to live in San Francisco if ten times as many people want to live there as can fit in that given space, so there is this question of certain things actually being scarce - some aren't - and there are different ways to alleviate that scarcity.<br><br>In San Francisco, for example, it's been very hard to actually develop more housing, and housing prices don't have to be increasing as fast as they are if other things in the system change. That does sort of get to your point about how we can try the basic income thing, but if there are a lot of these other factors that aren't budging, does all that gain get eaten up in various places? With housing, there's the big problem of there not being enough housing stock, particularly in urban areas, and housing's very heterogeneous. It's not like we're seeing increases in housing prices across the entire United States. We're seeing it in San Francisco and Boston.<br><br>In terms of education, that's a complicated one. There are certain absolute things and relative things. With education, you certainly can always teach yourself something, and that's very valuable, and that can stay with you forever and impact your life. There's also a large component of education that is actually chasing a positional status good. If only 2000 people can make it into Harvard, those people are going to spend increasing amounts of resources not just going to Harvard, but also the prep schools that get you into Harvard, test prep, whatever. As long as you have these limited spots, people are always going to try to chase them, so that can drive education prices a lot.<br><br>Healthcare is very complicated. Almost every other developed country in the world has moved to rationing and fixing the price of healthcare. In the US it's a very different system where we actually can chase nearly arbitrary prices increases, and particularly in healthcare, when you look at where additional spending is coming from, it's from end of life care. The vast majority of medical expenses are spent at the very, very end of life to generally eke out literally months - if you're a cancer patient with most available therapies, it's extra months of life for hundreds of thousands of dollars per treatment. We could ration that. It ends up being this very contentious problem; when Obamacare was proposed, a lot of the conversation was around death panels, which would tell you, \"No, you can't get this treatment because it's too expensive.\"<br><br>So then you can talk about drug pricing - should we be doing something there? It ends up being this very complicated, hairy problem that in theory you could attack from a lot of different directions, but if we're going to talk basic income, again, just like you don't get to necessarily live in San Francisco, you also don't get the $300,000 cancer treatment on your basic income. Is there enough food to go around? Yes, if you're willing to eat rice and beans rather than caviar every day. Is there enough housing to go around? Yes, if you live in Memphis, not San Francisco. Is there enough medical care to go around? Yes, if you're not getting $300,000 new cancer treatments."

At the same time, it's one that we're ready for. We're having a lot of difficult conversations about income inequality, about equity, about access. Is your zip code going to be the definition of where you go in life?<br><br>We have this opportunity, with more visible forms of automation coming in the next few years, to discuss what an income floor looks like. I think that's one thing these discussions do. But we're really still just at the education phase right now.

On top of that, he was concerned that basic income would kind of wipe away a lot of imperfect, but highly targeted programs focused on poverty and extreme poverty in America. How do you respond to that?"

I think all the sort of partial equilibrium, static analysis of basic income is completely, utterly flawed.<br><br>Still, taking it at face value for a moment, Bob's analysis is wrong on many different counts, and people like Scott Santens have done a good job of taking it apart. For instance, it doesn't take into account that at present in the US, very people pay few federal income taxes. Why is that? Because they live below the federal poverty line. Bob was counting the gross transfer as opposed to the net transfer, and that's the simplest and most obvious mistake in Bob's calculation.

We have to figure out a way to decouple research from the funding of research through the making and selling of pills, or we will always end up in the scenario where we're spending a lot on end of life care.

For example, San Francisco has 6,800 homeless people who live here. They are of all different backgrounds and capacities. Some people are conditionally homeless, have just lost their job, and can integrate back into the system.<br><br>We have another 2,000 people who are chronically homeless. Within that subgroup, there's an even smaller subgroup called the HUMS - High Users of Multiple Services - and they cost about $80,000 a year because we treat them through the emergency room. Just to give you a really specific case example, two weeks ago an older man asked me for some money, so I took him out to lunch. It turned out he was a Persian Gulf War veteran in his fifties with severe short-term memory loss. He was actually housed in a veterans' homeless supportive housing building, and because of his neurological issues, he had wandered out of the building several months ago even though he had housing.<br><br>I called them, they had a record of him, and they said that because he was away so long, they marked his unit as abandoned and gave it to someone else. I had to go through this process where I contacted the VA nonprofit. I said, \"Here's this guy, he's sleeping at this intersection.\" He didn't like using tents because it reminded him of serving in the military. They had to send a case worker out to do an intake, figure out his situation, and get him rehoused.<br><br>There's this kind of naive assumption that you can just give everyone income. For a lot of people, if they're young and able and want to work, that can genuinely serve as seed funding, but there's this other reality that we have a vast, rapidly aging population where people is so old, they're probably not going to be able to work in the system anymore, and the case management to track them down, find them, and rehouse them is intensive but also necessary from a governmental perspective.

I'm very optimistic where we can get to, but I'm somewhat pessimistic about how we get there. If you think about how we got from the agrarian age to the industrial age, it was through a series of revolutions and two world wars.<br><br>The biggest problem was that at the end of the agrarian period, the people who were politically in charge were the people who came from the land. When they saw what industry could do, they saw the ability to build tanks and battleships to get more land. Now, the people in charge politically have been brought up in a world where it is all about capital, and they see that they can capture people's attention and use that to have more capital and higher stock prices. That is no longer the problem, but we're still looking at it through this lens, and we're not experimenting through the bigger changes that are going to be needed. As long as we cling to this model - and this is what is happening in all industrialized economies - they are trying to patch the industrial model, and like Wile E.

I think it's perfectly fine to tax the winners of the power laws pretty heavily at the individual and corporate level, and that won't change the amount of economic activity. Everybody, when they set out, thinks they're going to be the winner, and if you're the winner in a power law, even if you pay more taxes, it will be piddley compared to the rest, which will be an order or two of magnitude smaller.<br><br>The other thing I said in the book was that concentration of economic activity in large platforms is a problem for the economy. Right now, regulators are approaching these large platforms using the old regulatory tool book of antitrust law, which came from the industrial economy, so they're thinking about things like telling them they can only behave in a certain way - direct behavioral regulation - and I think that's very bad.<br><br>You can think about trying to split things up, but you want things to be large networks; it'd be bad if there were two Facebooks, and if I'm on the wrong one, I can't talk to you - that's a silly idea. But there are other types of regulation that will shift power from the center out to the edge in computing, and they have to deal with who can access what information. Right now, for instance, if I took Uber's app or Facebook's app and decompiled it, extracted the encryption keys so I could create an API that other people could program against, I would be breaking like three different laws. We have a lot of laws that concentrate power of computation in few hands, and that's probably a bad thing."

I think the reason Larry has things upside down on the economy is because he wonders why there isn't more output per person at a time when that's just the wrong thing to measure.
