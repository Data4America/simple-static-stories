Welcome to Unplugged—where we sit down with leaders, academics, entrepreneurs and politicians to explore the intersection of data technology, government and the future. Today's session is with Greg Ferenstein—editor of The Ferenstein Wire, author of The Age of Optimists, previously a journalist at TechCrunch, and has mostly dedicated his career to understanding politics in Silicon Valley. Let's get it started. Good to chat with you, Greg."

And from open-source culture, I was kind of led into the general philosophy of what Silicon Valley stood for— meritocracy experimentation—things like this. And I began to become fascinated more and more with Silicon Valley. I mean, that's when I kind of picked up technology—but it was through studying management first."

I wrote a pretty scathing op-ed in The Atlantic when I left graduate school, accusing political science of being more or less a giant waste of time (after I had come to realize that I had wasted four years of my life in a discipline that had no interest in making a difference in the world). The title of The Atlantic article was \"Political Scientists Ask Congress To Defund Political Science\"—or something like that."

It was a data visualization series on Silicon Valley's political endgame where I kind of dispelled the myth that Silicon Valley is Libertarian. I argue that they're a completely new type of political category within the Democratic Party that is very pro-capitalism, anti-regulation; but pro-government in a sort of an investor sense. So they like the government to invest in education, they like immigration, and they like free-trade; everything the government can do to make people the best versions of themselves."

      "text": "Yeah. It’s not a term that's probably going to stick, but in the book I called them \"Civicrats\" because the agent of change under the Silicon Valley model is the citizen. So, whether it's a parent-run charter school, someone using their car to carpool instead of using public transit, or citizen watchdogs looking at police data for potential racial bias, their solutions always try to empower citizens directly."

There is no conservative version of the “Civicrat.”  Silicon Valley is overwhelmingly Democratic; in the 2012 election, 83% of employees from top tech companies gave to Obama versus Romney; 63% of all donations since 2008 have gone to Democrats.  In my sample, only 3–7% of startup founders identify as Republican."

      "text": "I'm actually trying to pass the Easter ballot initiative, so I have about three or four. One, I think we need to fix the housing crisis. By one MIT economist's estimate, housing is the entirety of growing income equality over the last thirty years. So if we don't find a way to build more—a lot more—especially in our cities, we're not going to stop growing income equality. We need to solve, once and for all, housing affordability in the country. I think it would be a great idea to try out a basic minimum income, at least for a class of workers in select cities around the country. I would love if we could get vocational education into schools so that every student in the country should be able to take Udacity or Coursera and be on their way to a tech job for very, very little money—and be able to use that for high school graduation."

And if the city and the legislators won't pass them, they could be adopted by ballot measure next year."

      "text": "What do I say? Tactically, I don't know what they look like fifteen years out. I do know how they're already influencing the democratic party; and when I say Silicon Valley, I'm using that kind of as a moniker for high-scaled industries, and more generally—skilled workers in cities. So if you want to think about the demographic profile of the \"Civicrats,\" it's basically most people with a college degree living in a city—they tend to be liberal. And people with a college degree tend to be more “pro” free trade, high skilled immigrant, etc. That is an increasingly influential demographic, not just in terms of the money they give, but also—so around—was it 2004? —2006? —Democrats with a college degree outstripped those without a college degree."

      "narrator": "GF",
      "text": "And so it's not a question of when they take power—they already have taken power—on every single major conflict between, say, traditional labor unions and the communications industry. The communications industry has gotten the support of the Democratic leadership. That includes charter schools, high-skilled immigrants free-trade and increasingly on the sharing economy. So it's not a matter of IF they take power—they are in power—it's a matter of what they DO with their power when they begin to realize they're a separate faction and start doing things that are distinctly extreme for what it means to have this ideology."

Cities for six thousand years have been in the heart of major innovation; and at least one Silicon Valley person, the CEO of Zappos, has spent 300 million dollars of his own money (in) figuring out how to create model cities around the world—starting in downtown Las Vegas."

I think they’re going to give more money to her than anyone else. I’ve done some polling on presidential candidate preference and Hillary captures by far the majority of support in the Valley. (In my start-up poll she got about 50%, Bernie Sanders is like 26%, and Republicans were a rounding error.) But when you talk to—in private conversations—when you talk to the folks who really supported Obama, (folks) who gave a lot of money, I haven't talked to a single person in the Valley who is excited about Hillary’s presidency."

People are spending over 30% of their income on rent as far as affording a house. Affordable houses are inaccessible to 92% of San Franciscans. I think you have to make about $250,000 a year to be able to afford a home here."

Communities are being torn apart. Teachers can't afford to live in the city where they work. It is the single biggest issue in San Francisco—it’s a crisis point for the entire industry, which is spending God knows how many millions of dollars in increased worker wages just so workers can have a relatively short commute to the office (which today, is like 90 minutes)."

      "text": "So there is a single cause and a solution. The cause is a crazy amount of regulation. It can take years to approve a project. Neighborhood associations, which control the zoning laws around the city, are very anti-condo. They want to keep their kind of suburban single-family homes and they have delayed or denied many projects. And that's why the city grows about 5000 people a year—and it only builds about 1200 units. I've been (working on) that for a very, very long time. The solution is very simply just to bulldoze all of the regulations on density, height and the lengthy public approval process; but it will have to be done through a ballot measure because, for whatever reason, the city legislatures are absolutely terrified to take it on."

Right now, I’m working on one that forces the city to kind of develop a plan that it was otherwise afraid to talk about publicly. And very soon, I’ll likely be doing one that actually takes on the regulations themselves. I don't have a lot of confidence in the city to follow through on the study and so I'm going to write the laws (myself) to basically ban the regulations—and see if we can pass it that way."

Congress isn't doing much, the San Francisco legislature won't pass anything bold, and California state legislature is no more interesting. Right now, I've focused all of my efforts on ballot measures where I know that when a majority of citizens want something they can get it passed—they don't have to ask for permission. You know, I always encourage progressive people to run for office and certainly, you know, in a generation, that will be important.

It happened in the 1990's with something called the “clipper chip” when the Clinton administration wanted to put kind of a backdoor listening device on cell phones around the country. And then, the kind-of-a tech powerhouse at the time, Microsoft, teamed up with the industry generally and got the “clipper chip” squashed. So there is a history of government officials trying to do exactly this (related to encryption technologies) and losing."

I think we're entering into both very optimistic and dangerous territory. Optimistically, I think robots will give us unprecedented amounts of leisure time, dramatically raise consumption of quality, allow people to live like kings and queens. And robots will do all sorts of stuff we never wanted to (do) and so we're trending towards a life that is much like college, but permanently. The problem with that is that income inequality at the same time is probably going to rise. And so we need to make sure that people are using their time productively; otherwise, you’re going to get more of this populace stuff, like Trumpism, because people are laid off work and they have nothing to do."

You're one of my favorite thinkers at the intersection of these topics—it’s kind of opaque for folks who don't live and breathe this stuff. It means a lot for you to take your time and share your experiences, visions, and ideas of the future—and it's promising! (It) gives me hope that you're getting your hands dirty in helping some of these ideas come alive. That's the type of leadership that not only the Bay Area needs, but the country needs. And, you know, I like the idea of… I’ve been fascinated by watching my friends in the writing business turn into metro capitalists, thought you're the first one that I can say will have turned into—bringing thought to action in the world of politics. So that’s exciting [inaudible]."

Since we've launched Data4America in July, Greg's been top of our list of someone we wanted to get involved with our mission to bring data science and data visualization to the understanding of politics. We have a number of esteemed guests lined up, and it's an honor to have Greg as our first official guest on Data4America/Unplugged. I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did. If you did enjoy it, I would love if you’d share this podcast with your friends: email it to them, share it on your messaging platforms, push it on Twitter, push it on Facebook. It means a lot when you do share—and to make it easy, you can send your friends to Data4America.org/Unplugged. As we said, we have a roster lined up with more guests and also more interviewers. If you have ideas of people you’d like to have on the show (discussing the intersection of technology and government in the future), just send me an email to Chris@data4america.org and we'll be in touch. I want to give a special shout-out to our donors, Data4America, our board of directors, and to the many people who have helped build this from ground zero. We're still in the first inning—and it's a very inspiring mission. Until next time…"
