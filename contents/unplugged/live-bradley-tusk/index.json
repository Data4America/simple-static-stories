       "text":"This is Chris McCoy, the Executive Director at Data4America. Welcome to Unplugged, where we explore the intersection of data science, technology, government, and the future. Today’s session was recorded in New York City – our first one on the road – with Bradley Tusk, the CEO of Tusk Ventures. In 2009, Bradley ran Michael Bloomberg’s campaign for mayor. In 2011, Uber hired Bradley to run a campaign against New York City to enable Uber to work alongside taxis – Bradley won.<br><br>That kicked off his regulatory arbitrage practice. Now, Bradley is one of the most interesting people at the intersection of working with governments and technology companies. This was a fascinating discussion and probably my favorite to date.<br><br>If you enjoy it as much as I did, please share it on Twitter, on Facebook, on email. If you have ideas for folks you’d like us to interview in the future, just email me – chris at data4america dot org. Let’s go in!"

My career didn't follow a totally linear path, and I think that ended up being helpful because the kind of business that I started - and run now - depended on that weird set of experiences.<br><br>I really loved government when I was a kid. I got started in politics in 1992, when the Democratic convention was here at Madison Square Garden - it was Bill Clinton's election year. I'm a first-generation American, and we didn't really know anybody, but my dad had a friend who was a lawyer for the carpenters' union. He says, \"Hey, I can get you a one-day pass to the Democratic convention. Do you want to go?\" because he knew I liked politics. I said, \"Yeah, I'd love that!\""

      "text": "I was 18. If you look at the newspaper, it says the convention is from noon to midnight. Now, anyone who's been to a convention knows it's [really from] 8PM to 11PM, but I'm this gullible kid - I don't know that.<br><br>So I show up at noon at Madison Square Garden. It's totally deserted. There's two guys running for state representative of Montana on the stage and no one else, but Ed Rendell - who was the mayor of Philadelphia, and went on to be governor of Pennsylvania - was sitting in the audience by himself.<br><br>He’s this very gregarious, friendly guy. I said to myself, \"Look, he's the mayor of Philly,\" and I just finished my freshman year at Penn, so I say, \"Hey, I go to school in Philly.\" He's actually from New York and so am I, so I think, \"What's the worst that could happen?\"<br><br>So I go up to him and he's super friendly, because that's just how he is, and we talked for 10, 15 minutes. I realized my time should be up, I say, \"Thanks so much, I really appreciate talking to you,\" and he says, \"Are you busy after school?\"<br><br>I said, \"No, not really,\" and he said, \"Do you want an internship?\"<br><br>I said that'd be great, and he said, \"Send me a note, we'll set it up.\"<br><br>I'm very excited. I go home, I write a letter. Every day, I open the mailbox, and there's no reply. What I know now but didn't know then is that correspondence is like the black hole of government. Everything goes in, nothing comes out.<br><br>I get back to school, but I'm still kind of interested in doing this. I had this weird thought that I'd go see him.<br><br>I go to City Hall - it's a decade before 9/11, so security's not what it is today - and I get not to his secretary, but to the outer office. I walk up and ask, \"Is the mayor here?\"<br><br>Now that I'm an adult, in retrospect, that's a crazy question. You can't just walk up and ask to see the mayor. But I was so young and naive that they kind of took pity on me. I wasn't protesting anything and I wasn't crazy, I was just sort of this nice young kid that didn't realize that you can't just ask to see the mayor of Philadelphia.<br><br>They said, \"He's a little busy,\" so I said, \"Is it okay if I leave a note?\" and they said sure. I write a note and get back on the subway to go back to my dorm, and I’m thinking, \"You idiot, what's wrong with you? You can't do that.\" I thought I'd blown that chance and it was never going to happen. Then I'm sitting in my dorm room about twenty minutes later and the phone rings. \"Hold for the mayor.\"<br><br>He says, \"When are you coming to work?\" I said, \"I'll be right there!\"<br><br>And that was how I got started. Since then, I ended up working in multiple levels of government: city government for Rendell when I was in college, for the New York City Parks Department when I was out of college, and then for Mike Bloomberg at City Hall and running his mayoral campaign in 2009.<br><br>In state government, I spent four years as Deputy Governor of Illinois and two years on the Hill as Chuck Schumer's communications director. I also spent about two years at Lehman Brothers creating and running a group to privatize state lotteries, which had the impact of having me in every state capital about five days a week going from capital to capital. The net effect of all of that was that I ended up on this weird journey in New York, DC, Chicago, and Philly - and traveling constantly – and really understanding state, federal, and local government, but especially state and local government all over the country.<br><br>When I started my first business, which was a consulting firm, the idea was that we were going to run campaigns for big companies in multiple jurisdictions. No one was doing anything like that before. People would either work nationally or they had a specific skillset - they were a pollster or an ad maker - or they would do a lot of things in one market, like DC or Albany. I said I was just going to run campaigns, since it's what I'm good at, but I'm going to do it everywhere. And it worked.<br><br>So I'm doing this for the usual suspects: AT&T, Wal-Mart, Comcast, Pepsi, and so on. The pivot tack that brought us here was the day the phone rang and someone said, \"Hey, there's a guy with a small transportation startup having some regulatory problems. Would you mind talking to him?\"<br><br>This is early 2011, so I become Uber's first consultant that day, and I get even luckier when Travis [Kalanick] calls me and says, \"Hey, I can't afford your fee. Would you take equity?\" and thank God I said yes. He had a particular problem in New York. We solved that problem, and he said, \"Can you do this everywhere else?\" and I said yes, then we did it in Boston, Philly, Chicago, DC, Miami - the whole country. That's how I got started in tech - being Travis's political consultant. We built a big in-house team. I still work with Uber, but there's obviously a lot of people there to do most of the work now, so I just give my opinions and go on TV and talk about things, and that's fine.<br><br>About a year and a half ago, the mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio, had this very ill-conceived idea to put a cap on Uber's growth of 1%. One of his biggest donors is the taxi industry, and they literally wrote the bill and handed it to him, then he submitted it to the city council.<br><br>I remember sitting in the Dallas airport. The phone rings, it's Travis, and he says,\"Did you see what just happened?\"<br><br>I say, \"No, I'm stuck at DFW, it's raining, my flight's canceled, whatever.\"<br><br>He says, \"Check it out and call me back.\"<br><br>So I go online, see what happened, and call him back. I say, \"I have two questions: is there anything I can't do, and how much can I spend?\"<br><br>To his great credit, he said, \"Whatever you need to do and spend, just make sure we win.\"<br><br>We ran this very fucking vicious campaign, going after de Blasio incredibly hard from the left. We had drivers and passengers saying it was racist to take these opportunities away, we put a de Blasio mode on the app with a 25 minute wait time, we made it possible to click to contact City Hall."

We ran the most multifaceted, aggressive campaign you could imagine, and at the end of it, they called and basically waved the white flag. There's that adage that you can't fight City Hall, but we did and we won.<br><br>When you win campaigns you're not supposed to win, you get maximum attention, and we got a lot of attention. This was an opportunity for me to take what I really loved doing - working with startups - and expand significantly.<br><br>We launched Tusk Ventures, which is a business that works with lots of pre-IPO companies in regulated industries to solve problems in return for equity, such as FanDuel - we're working on passing legislation regulating fantasy sports in dozens of states - or Handy - we're trying to create a new form of worker classification - or for Eaze - we're trying to rationalize cannabis delivery laws - or Altschool - we're trying to figure out how their model could fit into charter schools and parochial schools and things like that.

They ran a really good campaign, and Rudy did a really good job - I think he's been lionized for it, he's had some challenges since - of running the city. He endorsed Mike, and it was all enough for him to win by two points.

It was the culture and approach to hiring that really did it. What Mike did that was so radical was that he solely hired people based on merit and talent. He didn't care about politics, who sent him, or if it could help his re-election. Even more importantly, he told all his direct reports that they had to do the same thing.<br><br>As a result, you had 12 years of a couple thousand people in city government who normally wouldn't work in city government. He created a culture that thought big, had big ideas, and would try them, and failure was okay if you worked hard, were honest, and did things for the right reason. Some things failed - the attempt to win the Olympics for New York didn't happen, the attempt to put tolls on the East River bridges didn't happen. But for every two failures, 20 things worked, and it adds up over time.<br><br>He ended up radically transforming the city in so many different ways. It was his management style, his culture, his approach to hiring, that enabled good things to happen. I've tried in my business to emulate that approach. I don't have a scintilla of his talent, but at least I can copy the way he goes about things."

The vast majority of the people who run for office are deeply self-loathing, insecure people who can't make it in any other field and desperately need the validation of holding public office so they feel like they're somebody. That psychological hold that holding office fills for them is so significant that they never make hard choices that are for the greater good against their own political interest. There's nothing that could matter more to them than filling that hole. As a result, they only govern in self-interest, which is why nothing ever gets done.<br><br>Mike Bloomberg is apolitical. He doesn't like politics. When I ran his mayoral campaign, every day at 5 AM I would send him an email that showed him what was going on and what I was up to. The best days for him were the days that we didn't talk again and he just went about his business being mayor. A perfect day for him was a day when he read my email, said, \"Got it,\" and didn't hear from me until the next morning at 5 AM. He's just totally unique in that situation.<br><br>Had he run for president, he would've been an amazing president because he would've brought in the same approach to hiring. He isn't loyal to any particular party, facet, ideology or special interest, just what he thinks is right. Sometimes his ideas would be considered very far left, sometimes far right. Most frequently he’s in the middle, but the reality is that they are just based on what makes rational, logical sense to him, and that's the best way you can possibly govern.

      "text": "I love the idea of people from the private sector, from tech, running for office. I'm looking for a mayoral candidate for New York City for next year. If anyone listening to this podcast is interested, I started a Super-PAC called New York City Deserves Better because our current mayor is the epitome of all the worst traits. He's highly corrupt – he currently is under seven separate federal corruption investigations - he's lazy - he doesn't come to work until about 11 every day – and he's inept and totally focused on politics to the exclusion of everything else.<br><br>I would love if someone with a really great tech mentality wanted to run, but the challenge is that Mike won only because of this totally world-changing, horrific thing. Otherwise, he wouldn't've won, and he'd be the first to tell you that.<br><br>In a normal election, electing someone from outside the normal paradigm is really hard. Very few people vote in primaries, and as a result, it's the most hardcore partisan, ideological group that is least receptive to the private sector and to technology. Frequently, they're members of a union and told to vote based on who's giving the union the biggest contract, so as a result in a normal election it's hard to do that, which is actually why I launched an initiative around mobile voting.<br><br>What I've found in my work for Uber and FanDuel is that it’s easier to get people to advocate on behalf of a for-profit company than to get people to vote in their own interest. The reason why is very simple: if they can do it on their phones, they're already on the platform. We can say, \"If you love this platform and you want it to stay, press this button and you can email your state senator, your representative, your city councilperson, your mayor, your governor, whoever it is.\" We make it so easy that people do it. If we say you have to walk a couple blocks, wait in line, figure out your polling place, and all this other stuff, they don't bother.<br><br>The problem is that in a typical New York City Council primary, turnout's about 15%. That means that someone wins with 16-18,000 votes, and they typically know who every single one of those people are. They govern solely to make sure that those people are happy to the exclusion of everyone else. When Bill de Blasio won the primary in 2013, he got 280,000 votes, and he governs a city of 8.4 million people for those 280,000 voters to the exclusion of the other 8.1 million.<br><br>However, the good news about politicians being the way they are is that they're adaptable. If turnout were 60 or 70 or 80% because you had a month to vote, it was on your phone, and Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter and Facebook bugged the shit out of you until you pressed the button and voted, people would vote. If all of a sudden the same city councilman said, \"Hey, 70% of my constituents voted - not 15%,\" he or she would then govern toward the interest of that 70%. They're pragmatic. If you want to save democracy from the polarization and dysfunction you see in Washington right now, you've got to increase turnout. All the Rock the Vote campaigns that have existed since the early 90s won't work nearly as well as saying, \"Everyone, all you have to do is pull out your phone,” which is effectively ubiquitous at this point, “and just vote.\" I understand that there are hacking risks and engineering challenges, but we do more complicated feats of engineering every single day. It could happen. We're working on that right now."

I'd be happy if some random place did a school board election - anything to get proof of concept. I think the concept itself is so radical and so important that it'd get a ton of media attention, and that's what drives other politicians. It may be 15, 20 years until it's how presidential elections are determined, but frankly, it's less important in the presidential election because people will turn out to vote for that.

We're only sixteen months into this experiment, and we'll see if it works, but there are a lot of really smart political people from both parties I like working with. On the polling side, Doug Schoen, Jeff Pollack, and Fred Yang are all really terrific. People like Bill Knapp and Jimmy Siegel make wonderful ads. There are so many people in different parts of politics. Howard Wolfson is the smartest political communications person I've ever worked with or met. There are great strategists like Kevin Sheekey.<br><br>It's not limited to any one party - there are really smart people who work with Republicans, Democrats, and Independents, and a lot of it depends on who you've come across in your career. I've been lucky to work with a lot of smart people, but the question is how much is that paradigm changing?<br><br>I had a piece that ran in TechCrunch over the weekend that talked in part about mobile voting, but also about how Reed Hastings may be the solution to the problem of money in politics. Ultimately, what drives campaigns today is raising money to be able to run TV ads. 80% of the spending in any big campaign is on TV, but the efficacy is... when was the last time you watched an actual TV ad?"

As fewer and fewer people watch live TV, the efficacy of those ads keeps falling. Once political consultants and campaigns realize that and it goes away, the need for that kind of money is going to decline precipitously. Digital ads will fill the void to a certain extent, but the spend can't be disproportionate to what everyone else is spending. The reason why TV is so expensive is because what PepsiCo or AT&T or General Motors spends is the rate. To buy a week's worth of decent TV in New York City, you're spending $1.5 million. That's what drives it. If you're running for Congress, your limit is $2700 per person, so you have to raise $3, $4 million just for TV. Think of how many phone calls you have to make that in $2700 chunks. As a result, you spend all of your time raising money and all your feedback comes from donors. That's how you govern.<br><br>The other solution to this equation would be for people to realize that live TV for campaigns is less and less useful. Eventually, you'll hit a point where the people who vote who tend to be senior citizens age out completely. Even people in their fifties probably aren't watching a lot of live news. That's what'll do it."

In the early days, when he was in New York, he'd come to our office and do his work from there, and we'd kind of talk about different political things going on with the company. He was working out of the conference room, and I'd sit with him. Most of the day, we were doing other work, and sometimes we'd have meetings, sometimes not.

While he's doing something else, my end of the conversation - which was fairly rudimentary, as it was the first time I was introduced to this issue at all - he's certainly not an expert on energy policy or exports, but as soon as I got off the call he explained the entire thing to me: the strategy, the underlying issues, how to win. It blew me away. I asked, \"How did you know all that?\" I don't think there was some secret trove of knowledge he had. He's just that smart.<br><br>Mike's the same way. I remember being in the car with him once and Kevin Sheekey, who's a big Mike guy, explains that Mike can hold two conflicting thoughts in his head at the same time. He can link up macroeconomic policy and microeconomic policy, human nature, media, trade, foreign policy, commodity pricing, all these different things into one narrative that makes sense, and explain it, because his brain can actually function like that. Most people have to cut it up into smaller, more digestible pieces and come up with a theory to tie it all together. That was my \"Wow!\" moment with him.<br><br>Their management styles are a little different. I didn't get to know Mike until he was in his sixties, and I got to know Travis in his mid-30s. Travis comes off as more aggressive than Mike; when he's that age, there may be something that comes from being so successful for so long that you can kind of be just as effective while taking half a step back in your tone and approach. In terms of people who have vision and drive and the ability to put lots of different things together and make incredible sacrifices, too...<br><br>A lot of the writing I do about career stuff I try to aim at millennials, and I think the main thing they don't notice is that it takes unbelievable sacrifice to succeed at even a normal level of tremendous success. It's working incredibly hard, it's taking all these other things that matter to you - not just your personal life, but to be able to be told no all the time, to handle rejection and failure. Mike Bloomberg got fired by Solomon Brothers and took his severance package and put that into creating Bloomberg, LLP. Uber isn't Travis's first startup. He got sued by the record companies - he had his own version of Napster and got sued for like a trillion dollars.

I think people are right to worry about it, but at the same time, throughout history things get invented that displace normal modes of production. Everyone says, \"Oh no, no one's going to have jobs anymore.\" Then industries adapt and new things evolve, so I'm not sure that I'm willing to accept the basic premise that Amazon Go or Auto or whatever means that 7 million cashiers and truckers are suddenly out of a job, or there won't be an adaptation we can't think of right now. If we could, we'd be doing that.<br><br>Number two, that's why ideas like universal basic income are out there. I like UBI - what may separate my perspective from that of the people pushing it is that I'm not sure any of them have actually worked in government. Having worked in government, I worry about the ability of politicians to not raid the revenue coming in set aside for UBI. In theory, it's sacrosanct, but in reality politicians have very creative ways of divvying up money.<br><br>I have an alternate approach I've been putting out there, I think I called it an idea that both liberals and conservatives will hate. The idea is that right now, if you take SNAP - food stamps - you and I pay a dollar on taxes, so we have to pay someone an additional 1 cent on the dollar to prepare our taxes, or for software to do it or whatever it is. It's then collected by a government agency, the IRS or whatever, that has employees and cost. It then goes to a legislative body to appropriate, which gets sent off in twenty different directions, 18 of which aren't that important. It then goes to a giant social service agency that has massive union contracts, bureaucracy, and inefficiency. It finally gets to a program, distributed in the form of food stamps to someone who's hungry. Of our dollar, how much made it to that person - ten cents? Twelve cents?<br><br>Based on my time in both the private and public sector, I would argue we should come up with a system that shifts 100 cents on the dollar. From a liberal perspective, let's pick a minimum wage that people can really live on - $15, $20 - and say this is the kind of healthcare people have to have, this is the kind of policy around paid leave, sick leave, family leave, whatever, and that's all a worker's paradise, right? The business owner says, \"I can't afford this, I'll go out of business.\"<br><br>But you say, \"Look, we're going to hold you harmless. The delta from what you're spending before to what you're sending now will all be deducted from your taxes or credited back to you, which means at the end of the day P&L hasn't changed at all. You have happier, healthier, better workers who have better incentives to stay and not be fired, workers are getting 100 cents on the dollar to support their families and put money back into the economy.\"<br><br>The loser in this equation is government, since you're saying that rather than having these massive bureaucracies, agencies, and legislative and tax bodies collecting money, we're going to take the revenue away from government and give it directly to the worker. Liberals hate it because they don't want to see government starve - they believe in big government - and unions' political contributions sustain their campaign funds.<br><br>Conservatives will hate it because they don't like the idea of businesses being told what to pay, or there being healthcare regulations, or leave policies, or anything else, but it would be the most efficient transfer of wealth from point A to point B while helping businesses be more productive and efficient at reducing waste, which mostly occurs in government.<br><br>It's a different take on UBI - it gets to the same place, but the hole in my theory is that no matter how well you do that, there will still be a group of people who are mentally ill, or drug addicts, or alcoholics, or disabled, or otherwise unable to hold down a job, and they're still going to need some sort of safety net, but that's a radically smaller subset of the total population. With UBI, I worry about the integrity of it not from the people proposing it but from the reality of how government politics works, or my idea, which hopefully achieves the same thing but removes the ability of politicians to screw it up, I think something like that is going to be necessary.<br><br>If you have that, maybe you have a situation where people work 8 hours a day, play 8 hours a day, sleep 8 hours a day - the original notion of utopian society is that people aren't working around the clock because enough systems, technology, and wealth are created that it's not necessary. Who's to say that we can't get to that point?"

I am not bullish on the future of recreational drones because of regulation. The way I see it is that there are so many intersecting jurisdictions that can regulate recreational drones. A local park district, a local airport, a local stadium, a city, a town, a county, a state, the FAA, DOT... there's no way any of these companies have the bandwidth to survive all these different competing levels of regulation, registration laws, everything else. Every time that somebody flies their drone, intentionally or not, into the stands at a football game, every politician says, \"Hey, I'm having a press conference tomorrow on new regulations for recreational drones.\" At the end of the day, it won't be able to survive that.

Absolutely.<br><br>We've talked to companies who use drones to survey oil rigs and complicated energy sites, to move things in warehouses... there are so many ways that commercial drones add value, and the question is how you properly regulate them. My argument would be a pretty light touch. I think someone should be able to do whatever they want inside their own warehouse. Should drones be armed? No. I would like to see de minimis regulation on commercial drones absent a clear and compelling case that the activity would otherwise be dangerous. I wouldn't necessarily impose a lot of restrictions on recreational drones, either, but it's going to happen. The temptation is too great for the politicians to do it - there's too much of a chance of them getting in the way of fighting a forest fire, or flying too close to an airport."

The Uber flying car designs are effectively some sort of drones carrying people in little containers - some are cooler than others, but that's what it is, and package drones, and everything else.<br><br>Here's the thing about autonomous cars we can hopefully get out as a concept: Trump's talking about a really big infrastructure bill, and any big infrastructure bill typically includes billions and billions of dollars for road construction. There's a whole giant industry that wants as much construction as possible. I would bet that no one is thinking about what kinds of roads we need when all cars are autonomous.<br><br>Road construction takes a long time and creates a lot of delays during the construction phase itself. If all cars are running at the same speed and talking to each other and there's no human element anymore, we may not need as much capacity as we think. If you're at peak efficiency, it may be that the roads we have are actually sufficient. Road widening is so expensive and so difficult that before we commit hundreds of billions of dollars do it, hopefully someone will stop and think and talk to Lewandowski, whoever it is, and ask what we really need. The reality is that what we have might actually be okay, and maybe the answer is it isn't.<br><br>My wife's from Austin, and Mopac, which is one of the big highways in Austin, is being widened because Austin is going from being the sleepy town it was 25 years ago to the ninth biggest city in America today and it wasn't built to handle all this traffic. It makes sense, but right now, when you're driving on it, you're stuck in all this construction and delays on top of all the normal traffic. In ten years, you may not need a wider Mopac.<br><br>I'm hoping that going forward, transportation planning and road building is synced up with the needs of autonomous vehicles.

I understood why: the jobs created doing the construction make them look like they're at least doing something. I don't think what's stopping Decatur from becoming the next Shanghai is the lack of another eight-lane highway. The problem isn’t that people can't get there, it's that there isn't a reason for people to go or stay there the way there used to be. We have got to make it a more attractive place, and that's not the virtue of having another road.<br><br>If we could take soy and coal and come up with a clean way to use it as fuel, that's something most of Illinois has either under or above ground, and that would be an argument for how to rescue downstate Illinois. I was pretty sure that it wasn't roads or prisons - we had five fully empty built prisons, and we wanted to close them because no one was using them, but you can't because people work there and need jobs.
